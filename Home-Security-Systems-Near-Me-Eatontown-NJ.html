<p>Slightly more expensive than our winning smart alarm, this system was almost as simple to install and, during testing, the loud, clear siren was quick to sound if one of the sensing units had been activated. We love that the system includes a wifi security camera and just alerts you when motion is produced by something with the very same heat pattern as a human (guaranteeing there's no incorrect informs). Nevertheless, you do need to register for the external monitoring service (from ₤ 12.99 per month) to be able to see recording from the wifi security camera and get notifies on your phone if the sensing units have actually been activated.
