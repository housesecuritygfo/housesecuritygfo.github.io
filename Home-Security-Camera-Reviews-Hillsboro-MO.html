Professional monitoring typically carries a monthly cost on top of your equipment cost. We recommend having your home professionally monitored due to the fact that of the additional layer of security that's in place should you be far from home when something takes place. Without professional monitoring, you'll be responsible for monitoring your own home, normally with a mobile app and activity alerts.</p>
