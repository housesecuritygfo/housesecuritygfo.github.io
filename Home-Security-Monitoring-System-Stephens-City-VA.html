<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in many cases, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky.

Indoors, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, and even in a garage without climate control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the severe environment.</p>
