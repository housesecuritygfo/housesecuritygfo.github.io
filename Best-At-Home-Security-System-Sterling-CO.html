<p>MAC filtering is effective only for small residential (SOHO) networks, considering that it provides protection just when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" freely transfers its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no special equipment or software application to discover it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within range.
