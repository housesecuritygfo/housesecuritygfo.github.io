We like that the system includes a wifi security camera and only notifies you when motion is developed by something with the same heat pattern as a human (making sure there's no false alerts). However, you do require to subscribe to the external monitoring service (from ₤ 12.99 monthly) to be able to view recording from the wifi security camera and get signals on your phone if the sensors have actually been activated. There's no external alarm either. Other packages are offered that have essential fobs and extra sensing units, too.</p>
