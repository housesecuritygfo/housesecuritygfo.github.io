<p>Registered for service for my Simon XTi and was active with their service an hour later on. The company that installed my alarm went out of business so I was on the hunt for a new monitoring company. These people are $18 a month less expensive and stayed in business 3 decades so I'm comfy giving them a try. Desire I had looked previously but honestly didnt realize I might save cash until required to look when my dealership folded.</p>
