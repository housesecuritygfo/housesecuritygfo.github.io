<p>In the past, a surveillance security system normally consisted of a number of cameras connected-- either hardwired or wireless-- to a digital video recorder (DVR), which recorded the images and showed them on a closed circuit television (CCTV) or monitor.

Whether you have one camera or several, they work with your home's internet network to send video right to your computer or mobile phone.

<h3>Business Security Alarms in Ellijay GA</h3>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not great-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 uses no totally free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only by means of a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have awful night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far too many motion sets off.</p>
