<p>Like the Nest Web Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face signals, which can identify people the camera is finding utilizing face acknowledgment. When it identifies a person in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to identify those individuals and will send smartphone signals with that information when they show up at your home.

We also found the feature to be more reputable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this feature was constantly asking us to recognize faces on a close-by TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) also provide a larger range of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
