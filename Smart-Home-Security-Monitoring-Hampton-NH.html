With a professionally monitored system, the property owner will be contacted by the monitoring company each time the alarm goes off, unless the house owner disables it rapidly.

<p>One essential exception: ADT has a landline monitoring plan that's $36.99 each month, which could be an affordable alternative for consumers in rural areas. We recommend cellular systems due to the fact that they're much more secure than landline systems, but there are some places where cellular monitoring isn't offered. If you live someplace without access to cellular monitoring, a landline system is still better than no security at all.</p>
<p>In the end, for the majority of clients, making the best option will boil down to the company's client service track record and your specific equipment requirements.

Which, you think of, would suffice to send even the most committed career criminal scuttling empty-handed down the road. </p>
