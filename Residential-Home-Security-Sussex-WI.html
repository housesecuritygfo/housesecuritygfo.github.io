On the easier side, with SimpliSafe, you trade the bells and whistles of smart home equipment for versatility and low prices. SimpliSafe does have a video doorbell with two-way audio, however you can't add a ton of other wise home tech to the system. It will not deal with loads of wise home equipment from other companies.
