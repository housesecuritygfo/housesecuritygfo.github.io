<p>We have all heard that old saying, you get what you spend for". This design from Samsung Wisenet will fit the bill if you're looking for a robust DVR system that feels premium and records in 2K quality. It ships with 4 white and sleek bullet-style cameras developed for indoor and outdoor usage. They're geared up with night vision tech that utilizes infrared LEDs and clever IR to provide up to130ft (or 40m) night vision range. Like others on our list, the DVR system deals with a mobile app that lets you see what the cameras are seeing in real-time, though we discovered in our screening that the app periodically forgot cameras which then required to be re-added.</p>
<p>After evaluating dozens of wired and wireless options, the best home security camera for many people is the Arlo Pro 2. It tapes high-definition, 1080p video both day and night, is completely wireless, and can be set up both inside and out, as it's weather resistant. Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there. We like that Frontpoint doesn't have a contract, and its equipment prices is very affordable, so it's not a total splurge. However you will pay more for Frontpoint monitoring than you would for the likes of Vivint or Brinks.</p>

<p>Any outdoor camera worth its salt need to have the ability to endure exposure to the elements and ought to bring an IP (Ingress Protection) rating IP scores consist of 2 digits that inform you simply how well the camera will hold up under a lot of weather conditions. The first digit following the IP prefix tells you how resistant the camera is to the ingress of solid things such as wind-blown dust and varies from 0 (no protection) to 6 (total protection against dust and dirt).

<p>Dome IP camera, as the name recommends, is a type of CCTV camera with a dome cover. However beyond that I just had problems.

I was performing the macarena in front of the camera for about two minutes prior to it even saw I existed. </p>
