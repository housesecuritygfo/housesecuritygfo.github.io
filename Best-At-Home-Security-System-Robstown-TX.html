The highest picture quality of DVD is just slightly lower than the quality of basic 5:1- compression DV.</p>

<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the entrance and after that combines the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks completely regular because the entrance and space appear to be at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of capturing video of everybody getting in the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras.
