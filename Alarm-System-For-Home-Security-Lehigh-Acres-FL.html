<p>MAC filtering works only for small residential (SOHO) networks, since it provides protection only when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" freely transfers its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no special equipment or software application to identify it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies just a false complacency because it prevents only "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational facilities and does nothing to avoid a directed attack.</p>
