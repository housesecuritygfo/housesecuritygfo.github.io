<p>According to a report, homes that do not have a security system are 3 times more likely to be robbed. Brinks owns and operates its own US-based monitoring center. Its monitoring service includes a benefit called ASAPer, which all at once messages a group of pre-set contacts to determine whether alarm activity is a true emergency or false alarm. A lot of monitoring center call household members one at a time, which can slow action times.</p>
<p>After testing, we sent each of our top choices, along with the Wyze Cam v2, to Costs McKinley, head of information security at The New york city Times (Wirecutter's moms and dad company), for hack screening.

Screens can be linked to the DVR for seeing, or the system can be set up to interact via network or mobile app for viewing.</p>
<p>When you have your new security system expertly installed, the professional will exist to help you set everything up correctly, reveal you how to configure it and match it with your internet and mobile devices, then reveal you how to use everything.
