The technology gradually evolved into the highly advanced yet budget friendly systems readily available today.

<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in many cases, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky.
