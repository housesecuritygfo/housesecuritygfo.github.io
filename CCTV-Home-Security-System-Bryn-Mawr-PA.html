<p>We do not recommend the SmartThings SmartCam because it's more complex than it should be. Recordings, alerts, and combination all require separate IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are stored for up to 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly fee (or $80 per year) to keep 30-second clips for one month. Beyond those limitations, we typically found action missing, thanks to inconsistent and lengthy gaps in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>

Some small-business owners will also like Nest's contract-free plan alternative.
