<p>When mounting cameras inside your house isn't an option, you may wish to check out hidden cameras, which are cameras that are small and discreet, in some cases fitted into everyday objects such as clocks, smoke detectors, and magnets.

Wireless security cameras may need less circuitry in the walls but will still need cable televisions to power the security camera individually, typically through 110VAC power. </p>
