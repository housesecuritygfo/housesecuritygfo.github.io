<p>Nevermind how great the cameras are. The first question you should be asking is which of these companies is selling your information to 3rd party companies? I've dropped my Nest Cams considering that they were purchased by Google. Something all of us need to consider. Sirens. So your camera has actually identified trespassers or wild animals.

<p>Many robbers enter your home or business when you aren't around. The come throughout the day, when you're likely to be at work or running errands.

Especially savvy lawbreakers will disguise themselves as service or shipment workers. They don't spend excessive quantities of time gunning through your possessions. They work rapidly: most burglaries are committed within a period of 10 minutes or less.</p>
