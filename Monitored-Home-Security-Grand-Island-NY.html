<p>MAC filtering works just for small residential (SOHO) networks, since it offers protection only when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" easily transmits its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no unique equipment or software to discover it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can acquire the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies just an incorrect sense of security given that it prevents only "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational infrastructure and does nothing to prevent a directed attack.</p>

<p>So far so normal. Things start to get actually fascinating with the Nest's facial recognition system. If the camera finds a face it does not recognise, it will send out a notice and picture to your phone, enabling you to give that person the once over.

You've got two-way audio, you can play tunes just to let the individual being viewed understand they're being watched, and you can select to tape-record video or images and save them to your clever gadget on an impulse. </p>
