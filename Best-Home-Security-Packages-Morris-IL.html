The typical reason for performing a DoS attack is to observe the healing of the wireless network, throughout which all of the initial handshake codes are re-transmitted by all gadgets, offering a chance for the malicious attacker to tape-record these codes and utilize different cracking tools to examine security weaknesses and exploit them to gain unauthorized access to the system.
