<h3>Outdoor Wireless Security Camera Manheim PA 17545</h3>
<p>With clear, HD video - day or night - it's easy to check in on the kids; 2- and four-legged alike. We first saw Wyze due to the fact that its super-cheap indoor security camera reminded us of Disney's WALL-E But once we tried it out, it quickly ended up being a personnel (and friends and family) fave. I do not recommend SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is absolutely nothing more than a sound maker. It can't send out informs, you can't manage it from another location, and you will not have access to their home security camera.</p>
<p>It works with a wire or without, with a Canary Smart base station or without, and can run indoors or inside - you get a lot of flexibility from this little device. We like the 1080p HD video quality, the 116-degree field of vision, the motion detection, and the detachable magnetic base which is basic to install. That's simply $0.66 a day (or about $20 a month) for basic home security equipment and the peace of mind of expert monitoring.</p>
