<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face notifies, which can recognize individuals the camera is finding using face recognition. When it finds an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to determine those people and will send out mobile phone alerts with that info when they show up at your home. We believe this feature (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are most likely to want to identify anticipated visitors from random strangers. We also discovered the function to be more dependable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this function was constantly asking us to recognize faces on a nearby TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) also provide a wider variety of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
