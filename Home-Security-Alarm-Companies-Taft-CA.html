<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face notifies, which can determine individuals the camera is identifying using face recognition. When it finds an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to identify those individuals and will send out smartphone alerts with that information when they show up at your home. We believe this feature (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are most likely to want to differentiate anticipated visitors from random complete strangers. We also found the function to be more reputable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this function was constantly asking us to identify faces on a nearby TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) also provide a larger series of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
