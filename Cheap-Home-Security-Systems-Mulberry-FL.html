<h3>Home Surveillance Equipment in Mulberry FL</h3>

When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 offers no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just through a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy.
