<p>A system that needs an agreement might be a smart option for those who are cash-strapped or do not want to spend for the equipment up-front. Why?

We have actually seen 1-year, all the way as much as 5-year agreements! On the other hand, we advise contract-free systems if you don't wish to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-term agreement (and who does?). Our choice: No agreement.</p>
