<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range".

As far as anyone is worried, the image looks totally normal considering that the entrance and space seem at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of recording video of everybody getting in the shop.
